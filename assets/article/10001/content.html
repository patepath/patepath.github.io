In Angular CLI version 6 or later, we can create multiple applications in a single project or workspace.
It is suitable for an enterprise that use a single repository and configuration for all Angular projects.

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We can share library and configuration for all projects
    <li>We will be got shared  a node_modules folder, you don't need to run npm for each project</li>
    <li>We can handle with a single git repository</li>
</ul>

<h3>Let's started</h3>
Create a new Angular project with no application by using --create-appliction false option. This project is called a workspace.

<p>
<div class="article-code">
    <code>ng new workspace --create-application false</code>
</div>

<p>
And then, change the directory to workspace folder and generate main-app as main-application and app1 and app2 as sub-application.
All application file structures were created in the workspace/projects folder.
<p>
<div class="article-code">
    <code>
        cd workspace<br>
        ng g application main-app --routing<br>
        ng g application app1 --routing<br>
        ng g application app2 --routing
    </code>
</div>

<p>
Run the applicaiton

<p>
<div class="article-code">
    <code>
        ng serve --project main-app<br>
    </code>
</div>

<p>
Or

<p>
<div class="article-code">
    <code>
        ng serve --project app1<br>
    </code>
</div>

<p>
Or

<p>
<div class="article-code">
    <code>
        ng serve --project app2<br>
    </code>
</div>

<p>
You can run main-app, app1 or app2 but can not run all simultaneously because all applications use the same port.
If you want to combine main-app, app1 and app2 together. You have to inject sub-applications (app1 and app2) to main-application (main-app).
