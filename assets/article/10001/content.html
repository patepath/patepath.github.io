In Angular CLI version 6 or later, we can create multiple applications in a single project or workspace.
It is suitable for an enterprise that use a single repository and configuration for all Angular projects.

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We can share library and configuration for all projects
    <li>We will be got shared  a node_modules folder, you don't need to run npm for each project</li>
    <li>We can handle with a single git repository</li>
</ul>

<h3>Let start</h3>
First, letâ€™s start by defining what is an Angular Workspace:

<p>
<div class="article-code">
    <code>ng new workspace --create-application false</code>
</div>

<p>
And then, change the directory to workspace folder and generate app1 and app2 applications in this workspace.
It will create an application file structure in the workspace/projects folder.
<p>
<div class="article-code">
    <code>
        cd workspace<br>
        ng g application app1 --routing<br>
        ng g application app2 --routing
    </code>
</div>

<p>
Run the applicaiton

<p>
<div class="article-code">
    <code>
        ng serve --project app1<br>
    </code>
</div>

<p>
Or

<p>
<div class="article-code">
    <code>
        ng serve --project app2<br>
    </code>
</div>

<p>
You can run app1 or app2 but can not run both simultaneously because all applications use the same port.
If you want to combine app1 and app2 together. You have to inject sub-appliction (app2) to main-application (app1).
